# citrus
A simple schedule generator written in Python

# What does it do?
Citrus is a command line based program that writes user input to a schedule file (.sdl).

# Why should I use this?
Unless you have a way to read the .sdl files, then this is probably entirely useless for you. Eventually I plan to make a GUI that reads and writes the file. If for some reason you stumbled across this project and absolutely must use it for some reason, you can edit the code to export to a .txt file instead of a .sdl file if you want.

# Why did you make this?
I made this to help myself stay organized. Being a college student is hectic, and it proved to be an effective way to keep myself from getting off track. I'm uploading it to GitHub because it might look good on a a resume someday. Who knows.

# Changelog:
This is a work in progress. The version that is avaliable on this repo is the last fully working version I have. Some features may not be avaliable in their entirety (or at all) throughout development.

V.0.01:
- Implemented generating .sdl files
- Implemented writing based off user input (Formatting will be improved in the next update)
