# citrus
A simple schedule generator written in Python

# What does it do?
Citrus is a command line based program that writes user input to a schedule file (.sdl).

# Why should I use this?
To make your own schedules, of course! Eventually I plan to make a GUI that reads and writes the file which will make the project alot more end-user friendly, but that's another project.

# Why did you make this?
I made this to help myself stay organized. Being a college student is hectic, and it proved to be an effective way to keep myself from getting off track. I'm uploading it to GitHub because it might look good on a a resume someday. Who knows.

# Changelog:
This is a work in progress. The version that is avaliable on this repo is the last fully working version I have. Some features may not be avaliable in their entirety (or at all) throughout development.

V.0.01:
- Implemented generating (very basic) .sdl files
- Implemented writing based off user input (Formatting will be improved in the next update)
