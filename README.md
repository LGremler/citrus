# citrus
A simple schedule generator written in Python

# What does it do?
Citrus is a command line based program that allows users to make and view their own schedules. Schedules are stored in the .sdl file format.

# Why should I use this?
To make your own schedules, of course! Eventually I plan to make a GUI that reads and writes the file which will make the project alot more end-user friendly, but that's another project.

# Why did you make this?
I made this to help myself stay organized. Being a college student is hectic, and it proved to be an effective way to keep myself from getting off track. I'm uploading it to GitHub because it might look good on a a resume someday. Who knows.
